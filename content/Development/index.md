Developers have multiple options for creating Matter-certified devices, bridges, or controllers. The official Matter SDK is the recommended choice for most projects, but alternative implementations, such as JavaScript, also offer compelling features for certain use cases.

The following table provides a general overview of various use cases for the available SDKs:

| Use Case                                                                  | Official SDK | JavaScript SDK |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Compliant with Matter version                                             | 1.4          | 1.3            |
| Participate in development of new Matter features                         | X            | –              |
| Use for embedded platforms with strict memory and performance constraints | X            | –              |
| Chipset-specific implementations (e.g. Wi-Fi/Thread)                      | X            | –              |
| Use on OS-based platforms: Linux, macOS                                   | X            | X              |
| Use on Windows                                                            | –            | X              |
| Ideal for rapid prototyping and testing                                   | –            | X              |
