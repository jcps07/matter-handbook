The JavaScript SDK implements Matter in pure JavaScript, utilizing TypeScriptâ€™s typing system for automatic data and system model compliant development. It can be used to build devices, bridges, and controllers running an operating system where a JavaScript runtime, like Node.js, is available.

This SDK includes ready-to-use example projects and is particularly suited for rapid prototyping and testing, thanks to its compliance-by-default approach and the simple but powerful API design.

To learn more, go to the [Matter JavaScript SDK documentation](https://matter-js.github.io/docs/index.html).

Note: Some features of the Matter protocol are not yet implemented in the JavaScript SDK. For details about this check the [matter.js Compatibility Information](https://github.com/project-chip/matter.js/blob/main/docs/MATTER_COMPATIBILITY.md).
