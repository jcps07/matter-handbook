The official Matter SDK, written in C++, is fully aligned with the latest Matter specifications and optimized for embedded devices with strict memory and performance constraints. It serves as the foundation for most chipset-specific SDKs.

The SDK is compatible with Linux and Darwin platforms and supports integration as a binary dependency for Python, Objective-C, and Java bindings. It includes several example applications for different platforms and supports configuration for various endpoints and clusters using the ZAP tool.
